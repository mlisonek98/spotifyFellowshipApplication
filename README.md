WELCOME TO THE CALENDAR

Created by Marko Lisonek for the Spotify Fellowship Application process

In this Application you can view all 12 months, and create an event for all of your up-coming events. The events will be displayed on the calendar with their start time and name.

You can also update existing events and delete them as well.

All the days of the week hovering over each column are in the correct order for the year 2018.

Have too many events on one day? The UI of this application handles that, so don't worry.

You Can See The Application Live At : https://spotifycalendar2018.herokuapp.com/
